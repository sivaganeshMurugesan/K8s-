Nodes:
containers are runs on Nodes. 

node creation:
There are two main ways to have Nodes added to the API server:

The kubelet on a node self-registers to the control plane
You (or another human user) manually add a Node object

node validation:
Kubernetes creates a Node object internally (the representation).
Kubernetes checks that a kubelet has registered to the API server that matches the metadata.name field of the Node. 
If the node is healthy (i.e. all necessary services are running), 
then it is eligible to run a Pod. Otherwise, that node is ignored for any cluster activity until it becomes healthy.
